# Zero Gs Please

Zero Gs Please is a small game development and student made project for a CSLA Fall 2023 Intro to Game Development course.
The game is about one or two astronauts entering the atmosphere of a planet to seek the resources to make the another jump to another planet, only using the most advanced of all planet hopping technology, a slingshot.
The idea of game is to land on the planet gather resources and explore the world then build a launch pad in order to hop to the next planet.

### Initial Pitch
Zero G's is a cooperative space exploration game that throws players in a fun exploration quest. In this space adventure, two players must work together to venture to different planets while maintaining their spaceship. Players venturing into the mysterious worlds can roam freely and interact with NPCs that may provide valuable information. These interactions are essential for progressing through the different worlds and will influence the character's journey.
The game offers captivating mini-games and spaceship customizability. While traveling to different planets, players will maintain the spacecraft by completing various time-based mini-games to prevent the ship from exploding as it travels to different planets. Mini-games become increasingly challenging, keeping players engaged.

### Alpha Release
The initial release is a short demo showcasing a couple of ideas put on paper. There are two levels to showcase one round of the gameplay experience which are the space level and planet-side level.
The space level is a minigame about entering the planet while dodge astroids, while the planet-side level is the main exploration and resource gathering part wheres players seek to build a new launch pad to leave the planet.

Co-op play is available by pressing a button on a secondary controller or keyboard.
